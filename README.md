## Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork}

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PRs may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.   

```terminal
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ATHARV-YOGI/Hacktoberfest2024
```

You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing:

```terminal
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repo, simply run:

```terminal
git merge upstream/master
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.

# About Algorithm Visualizer

**Algorithm Visualizer Visualize sorting algorithms in C++ with SDL2 Library**

A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts the elements of a list in a certain order. While there are a large number of sorting algorithms, in practical implementations a few algorithms predominate. In this implementation of sorting visualizer, we'll be looking at some of these sorting algorithms and visually comprehend their working. The sorting algorithms covered here are Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort. The list size is fixed to 130 elements. You can randomize the list and select any type of sorting algorithm to call on the list from the given options. Here, all sorting algorithms will sort the elements in ascending order. The sorting time being visualized for an algorithm is not exactly same as their actual time complexities. The relatively faster algorithms like Merge Sort, etc. have been delayed so that they could be properly visualized.
